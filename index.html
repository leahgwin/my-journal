    <h3>Day One: May 21</h3>
    <p>Today, I started my first day at the Web Developer Bootcamp at NSS. This morning I walked out to
        a large sign that said "YOU GOT 'DIS" that Benjamin had hung up above my favorite 'Make it Happen'
        coffee mug.
    </p>
    <p>We got to school and Steve, our C# instructor, walked us through the introduction slides
        that gave us a heads up about what bootcamp would be like. After this, we dove into using our 
        terminal and code editor. 
    </p>
    <p>So far, it has been a great day meeting all of the other cohort 26'ers and starting to learn
        what life will be like here at NSS for the next 6 months.
    </p>

    <h3>Day Two: May 22</h3>
        <p>
            The second day is almost over, so we're working on our journals. Today, we went over committing and pushing to Git Hub, so that helped me understand the process a lot more. We then touched on how writing to the DOM works, and how basically you never write normal, hard html (like I'm doing right now oops), but instead you write in Javascript to the DOM which converts it to html or something like that. A tad overwhelmed by that, so I'll probably review the DOM tonight. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Sat outside again for lunch with new folks until it started raining. We got to chat to some Cohort 25ers, which really relaxes my nerves and insecurities. They basically all say that every day is an achievement and every day YOU learn something new, so there is no point in compairing to others when you actually grew that day. Important life lesson but hard to convince your mind of that. haha.
